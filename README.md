Learning Data Structures and Algorithms From Scratch And What I learnt I providing Here...ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š

Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) in Java involve the systematic organization of data and efficient problem-solving techniques using the Java programming language.
1.Arrays
Arrays are fundamental structures in Java that allow us to store multiple values of the same type in a single variable. Arrays in Java are objects, which makes them work differently from arrays in C/C++ in terms of memory management
2.ArrayList
Java ArrayList is a part of collections framework and it is a class of java.util package. It provides us with dynamic sized arrays in Java. The main advantage of ArrayList is, It automatically adjusts its capacity as elements are added or removed.
3.Strings
In Java, String is the type of objects that can store the sequence of characters enclosed by double quotes and every character is stored in 16 bits  Strings in Java are immutable sequences of characters. Java provides a robust set of string operations, such as concatenation, substring extraction, and searching.
4.Stacks
A Stack in Java is a data structure that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle. In a stack, the last element added is the first one to be removed. In addition to the basic push and pop operations, the class provides three more functions of empty, search, and peek.
5.Queues
In JAVA queues store and processes the data in FIFO(First In First Out) order. It is an ordered list of objects limited to inserting elements at the end of the list and deleting elements from the start of the list.
6.Linked List
A linked list is a dynamic data structure whose size increases as you add the elements and decreases as you remove the elements from the list and the elements (nodes) are connected by pointers. Each node contains data and a reference (link) to the next node.
7. Trees
Tree data structure is a hierarchical structure that is used to represent and organize data in the form of parent child relationship. Where the topmost node of the tree is called the root, and the nodes below it are called the child nodes.
8.Hashing
In hashing there is a hash function that maps keys to some values. But these hashing function may lead to collision that is two or more keys are mapped to same value. In java there are various methods to implement hashing such as by using  HashTable or HashMap etc.
